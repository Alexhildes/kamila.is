The SCION future Internet architecture is a completely new approach to solving some of thecurrent Internet’s problems. Its viability has already been demonstrated -- we have a global research network [TODO scionlab image] and multiple commercial deployments.

---

To go beyond research, it must work in HW:  
throughput, cost, energy efficiency

⇒ make sure that it can be done; improve protocol design before it's too late

???

But to work at Internet scale, it is necessary to make it perform at high bandwidth, reduce costs, andevaluate its suitability for eventual implementation in hardware. So that's what we did.

# How?

methods for high-speed packet forwarding:

.centerblock.width80[![Methods for high-speed packet forwarding](/media/high-speed-packet-forwarding.svg)]

???

We have a software implementation, but that one can do less than 1Gbps. It's in userspace, so there's lots of opportunities for improving while staying in software, but... In order to be taken seriously e.g. by ISPs, we need to go up at least 3 orders of magnitude.

Tricks like eBPF or DPDK can get us about one order of magnitude, possibly two, but beyond that a CPU won't really work.

# P4 + NetFPGA

"normal" FPGA programming: _hardware description language (HDL)_: logic and connections

.floatright.width40[![P4+NetFPGA structure](/media/p4-netfpga-structure.png)]

P4:
* **high-level** and modular ⇒ less effort to write, maintain, port
* **looks like software** ⇒ less need for FPGA expertise
* **extensible**: supports `extern`s

but note: `p4c-sdnet` compiler is a PoC

???

P4 should be target-independent, but some degree of "porting" is still needed because in practice different targets have different limitations and may need different tradeoffs

signal propagation speed  
is finite

# Adding AES

SCION uses packet-carried forwarding state  
⇒ cryptographic check of the state on every hop

.floatright.width30[![P4+NetFPGA structure](/media/p4-netfpga-structure-extern.png)]

```c
@Xilinx_MaxLatency(10)
extern void my_aes128(
    in bit<128> K,
    in bit<128> data,
    out bit<128> result
);
```
* declaration generates an interface in Verilog, you provide implementation
  * must be pipelined
  * can only be called once (declare multiple if needed)

???

and beware of compiler bugs

# Implementing the parser

SCION header:

.floatleft.margin0[
![header stack](/media/header-stack-my.svg)
]

.floatright.margin0.width60[
path aware ⇒ route in header;  
pointer to "my" field

.light[(need to save the rest so we can emit in deparser)]
]
--

.floatright.margin0.width60.red[
NetFPGA does not support header stacks or `varbit`
]

???
my experience with NetFPGA, this would be different with a different compiler
spent way too much time trying to find workarounds and encountering bugs in the workarounds
(including an off-by-one in the compiler :D)

# Implementing the parser

.floatright.width30[![P4+NetFPGA structure](/media/p4-netfpga-structure-mod.png)]

Fix: instead of saving all fields, use `packet_mod` Xilinx extension:

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

```c
parser ExModDeparser(packet_mod p, in headers_t h) {
    state start {
*       p.update(h.ethernet);
        transition select(h.ethernet.ethertype) {
            ETHERTYPE_IPV4: deparse_ipv4;
            ETHERTYPE_IPV6: deparse_ipv6;
        }
    }
…
}
```

???

Xilinx extension, **not** standard P4 — but standard P4 can use `varbit`

# Implementing the parser

Loop to skip over unused fields: encountered a compiler bug...  
⇒ **Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: one for skipping 1 field, one for skipping 2, etc.**  

???

Select the correct sub-parser at runtime, but the jump size is fixed at compile time.

---

Problem: "Reasonably long paths" are at least 64 fields.  
⇒ Requires a lot of FPGA area + RAM to build it.

.moral[2-stage approach has **better** timing, because less area ⇒ better routing]

TODO moral to the story:
2-stage thing is a deeper circuit, but has better timing results because FPGA is less full and thus the place&route can do a better job

inherent complexity + workarounds for bugs ⇒ NetFPGA almost full (!) ⇒ at 200 MHz timing violated

fixing timing complicated by P4 ⇒ HDL translation

TODO would be cute to add a "bug" to the picture in places

# Meeting timing

* find critical path
* careful with data dependencies: delays accumulate
  * small modules with "tight" interfaces (e.g. correct use of `in`/`out`/`inout`) ⇒ more localised data dependencies ⇒ better timing
  * rewrite code like this:

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div style="position: relative; margin: -1em auto; width: 100%;">
.floatleft[
```sh
if [long computation 1]
then [long computation 2]
```
]
.floatright[
```sh
[long computation 1];
[long computation 2];
[combine the results]    
```
]
<div style="position: absolute; top: 1.4em; left: 52.5%;">⇒</div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: -1em;"></div>

???

restructuring my code gave me a 20% improvement on the critical path, in addition to better code

# High-speed packet processing

* P4 suitable even for complex protocols
  * line rate by default!
  * but: targets have notable limitations
  * not as target-independent as we had hoped
* P4-NetFPGA not suitable for complex things :-/
  * barely a PoC; very scarce documentation
  * hopefully we'll have more mature targets & toolchains soon
* FPGA-based implementations:  
  not that limited, though timing can be a problem

???
plus new compiler

# Improving the SCION protocol

* <strike>avoid state on routers, require few table lookups</strike> ✓
* define maximum sizes: path length, HF size
* avoid variable lengths
    * alignment is good ✓
    * explicit lengths instead of "continue" flags
* make things explicit
    * the header now has an addr type enum but no length ⇒ fix that
* re-think how to achieve our security properties:  
needing "usually" 1 AES core and "occasionally" 2 is silly, because you always pay for 2

# If I had a time machine...

&nbsp;

- I'd complete PoC first, production maybe later  
  (effort in the wrong places ⇒ I started hating the thing before I even polished the PoC)
- I **would** use P4:
  - a surprisingly good abstraction
  - line rate by default
- I'd get paid for it :D

???
- I would not aim at "production" before I have a prototype that guarantees that the basic functionality can actually work, because by the time I got to the end of the thing I was so burned out and full of hate that I didn't even polish the PoC :D
  - if I could know it in advance, I would not put my degree and pride in the hands of a horribly broken toolchain (but I'm not sure I could have known)
- I would still stick with P4 / HLS (esp. if I could have a better toolchain), because my network protocol is complex and P4 is a surprisingly useful abstraction that saved me a lot of effort and nerves
