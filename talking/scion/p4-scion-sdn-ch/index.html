 * packet-carried forwarding state

 * end-host selects path
 * ISPs decide available paths

_.hl[Isolation]_  
 * Isolation Domains (failures stay within one)
 * built-in DoS protection

.hl[_on Next-generation Networks]_  
 * new control plane & data plane (replaces IP + BGP)

# Isolation Domains (ISDs)

.floatright.width65[![ISDs](./img/isds.png)]

* e.g. ISD ≈ country
* PKI per ISD
* routing within ISD independent

* **Core ASes** manage ISD: PKI, inter-ISD control plane
* non-core ASes: only intra-ISD (simple)

---

class: expanded1

.floatright.width50[![PCBs](./img/pcbs.png)]

# Path discovery

* core ASes create *path construction beacons* (PCBs) & flood
* hierarchical:
 * inter-ISD:  
   among core ASes
 * intra-ISD:  
   only downstream
* AS receiving PCB adds itself & forwards it
  * ⇒ PCB contains known good path to core
  * adds its signature ⇒ PCBs can be verified

---

# Path discovery

* AS chooses how to extend / what to forward ⇒ enables routing policies
* available *path segments* registered to *path servers*
* end hosts request from path servers
* segments combined into end to end paths:

.displayinlineblock.width30[![segments example 2](./img/segments2.png)]
.displayinlineblock.width30[![segments example 2](./img/segments3.png)]
]

---

# Path discovery

every PCB contains *hop fields* for path construction:

* ingress, egress interface
* timestamp + expiration time
* chained cryptographic MACs with AS-specific keys ⇒ paths cannot be "invented"

# Packet forwarding

.floatright.width60[![forwarding path packet](./img/path.png)]

* path in packet header
* combine PCBs to build
* every border router processes only its own *hop field*
* checks to ensure path authenticity

.center[Modular, portable, high-performance P4 code for parsing, verification, and forwarding]

???

Now, why is this a good idea?
1. because modular code is easier to deal with
2. [NEXT] because you can base other things on it

---


.center.width100[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-breakdown.svg)]

???

you can take my BR and pick and choose which parts you want:

---

.center.width100[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-breakdown-swap-aes.svg)]

???

bring your own AES or even use a completely different MAC validation scheme

---

.center.width100[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-breakdown-parser.svg)]

???

change parser: swap your L2, use different encaps, or even parse the IFIDs in HFs in some special way

You could have a special-purpose end host with a P4-enabled SmartNIC, and do some of the data processing straight in the NIC => use my parser and deparser in a completely different architecture

# #3: Guidelines for high-speed P4

**a) P4+NetFPGA project template suitable for large projects**

* software-engineer-friendly
* simple way to add tests
* ready for multi-platform usage
* already used by 2 other ETH students

---

# #3: Guidelines for high-speed P4

**b) What have we learned about high-speed P4-based packet processing on FPGAs?**

Or, tips that help software engineers write code that performs well on hardware.

* Not yet clear (still learning!)
* simple example:  
  `inout` parameters get compiled into long paths, which makes it difficult to meet timing requirements ⇒ avoid them in critical spots

???

and where to look to find out which spots are critical

How can we adjust SCION to enable more efficient implementations in HW?

⇒ to answer, let's talk about the challenges...

so, those are the aims, now, how do we meet them? what are the most challenging aspects of the project?

# Challenges

???

the first challenge I encountered right at the beginning of the project was [NEXT] implementing the parser

---

layout: true

# Implementing the parser

SCION header:

.floatleft.margin0[
![header stack](./img/header-stack.svg)
]

---
???
my experience with NetFPGA, this would be different with a different compiler
---

.floatright.margin0[
First idea: Use header stacks:

```c
struct ScionHeader_t {
    …
    HopField_h[32] seg1_hfs;
    …
}
```
]

---

```c
struct ScionHeader_t {
    …
    HopField_h[32] seg1_hfs;
    …
}
```

.red[NetFPGA compiler does not  
support header stacks]
]

---

layout: false

# Implementing the parser

Fix: We don't need to parse the whole path, we just need to save it so we can emit it later ⇒ use a `varbit` field

.floatleft.margin0.width80[
![header stack](./img/header-stack-varbit.svg)
]

--

.floatright.margin0.red[
NetFPGA compiler does not  
support `varbit`
]

---

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

```c
parser ExModDeparser(packet_mod p, in headers_t h) {
    state start {
*       p.update(h.ethernet);
        transition select(h.ethernet.ethertype) {
            ETHERTYPE_IPV4: deparse_ipv4;
            ETHERTYPE_IPV6: deparse_ipv6;
        }
    }
    …
}
```

Xilinx extension, **not** standard P4 — but standard P4 can use `varbit`

---

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

1. modify NetFPGA design to use the `packet_mod`-enabled `XilinxStreamSwitch` architecture  
   .light[\* experimental :-)]
2. skip over the path with `packet.advance(size)`

--

.red[NetFPGA requires even `packet.advance(size)` to be a compile-time constant]

.center[Therefore…]

# Implementing the parser

.light[Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:]

1. .light[modify NetFPGA design to use the `packet_mod`-enabled `XilinxStreamSwitch` architecture]  
   .light[\* experimental :-)]
2. .light[skip over the path with `packet.advance(size)`]
3. **Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: one for skipping 1 HF, one for skipping 2, etc.**
   Select the correct sub-parser at runtime, but the jump size is fixed at compile time.

---

# Implementing the parser

Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: up to max length.

Problem: To support reasonably long paths (~64 HFs), we need a lot of sub-parsers.  
⇒ Requires a lot of FPGA area + RAM to build it.

# Portability

* keeping the code portable despite the differences in P4 support
* making it simple to compile this BR for a different platform

---

# Portability

Pieces of the solution:
* preprocessor `#define`s decouple platform from features; code depends only on features
* well-thought-out repo structure => minimise work needed to add new platform
* do it & document it

Planning to support at least:
* NetFPGA
* P4lang's software switch

---

# Parser Performance / Timing

* at 200MHz, the timing is very tight, mostly due to the parser
* need to figure out how to improve this
* complicated by P4 => HDL translation
  * no direct control over the resulting design
* interestingly, a "hand-made" Verilog implementation has the same problem
  * by another student here at ETH

---

# Making progress quickly

* modular design makes it easier to test incremental changes and locate bugs
* tackling the hard bits first ⇒ I can't get stuck
* **the NetFPGA's P4 stack is pretty much a PoC**; documentation is generally severely lacking  
  therefore:
  * try things ASAP
  * change plan if something doesn't work
  * **guess**

# Suggestions for the SCION protocol

* <strike>require few table lookups</strike> ✓
  * tables need a lot of FPGA area => a lot of power
* define maximum sizes:
  * max path length
  * max HF size
* make things explicit
  * include end host address length in header
* consider re-thinking MAC chaining for peering paths
  * further research into the tradeoffs is needed

# Future plans

* SCION packet header redesign
* production-readiness
  * handle all the cases
  * with a different P4 compiler...
* power requirements measurement/optimisation
  * compare with IP
* make it faster!
  * 1Tbps using multiple FPGA-enabled NICs
