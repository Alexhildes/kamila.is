# Intro
Why? What?
---

# Why? (TODO this slide is terrible)

- SCION is an Internet architecture for the future: Scalability, Control and
  Isolation On Next-generation networks
- already deployed in practice (SCIONLab, Anapaya)
  - all software-based ⇒ limited throughput, high $$$ per bit
- in order to succeed, SCION must work well in hardware
  - throughput, cost, energy efficiency
- the sooner we try to make a HW implementation, the earlier we can improve the
  design to work better in HW

# P4

FPGA design is very time-consuming, requires expertise, and changes cost a lot of effort

⇒ P4: language for programming packet forwarding planes
* **high-level** ⇒ less effort to write and maintain
* **target-independent** ⇒ same code runs on many platforms (in theory :D)
* **looks like software** ⇒ less need for domain expertise

---

# How do FPGAs work?

* software: sequence of instructions
* FPGA: circuit; data moves through

# Forwarding in SCION

.floatright.width60[![forwarding path packet](../img/path.png)]

* PCFS: path in packet header
* every border router processes only its own *hop field*
* checks to ensure path authorisation ⇒ AES-based MAC

---

.center.width100[![Parts of the project](../img/scion-breakdown.svg)]

???

* modular
  * because easier to deal with
  * swapping parts makes sense (e.g. AES or encaps)
  * because you can make other things with it
* integrated with existing SCION infra
  * control plane
* monitoring / metrics

my experience with NetFPGA, this would be different with a different compiler

# Implementing the parser

Fix: We don't need to parse the whole path, we just need to save it so we can emit it later ⇒ use a `varbit` field

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

```c
parser ExModDeparser(packet_mod p, in headers_t h) {
    state start {
*       p.update(h.ethernet);
        transition select(h.ethernet.ethertype) {
            ETHERTYPE_IPV4: deparse_ipv4;
            ETHERTYPE_IPV6: deparse_ipv6;
        }
    }
    …
}
```

Xilinx extension, **not** standard P4 — but standard P4 can use `varbit`

---

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

1. modify NetFPGA design to use the `packet_mod`-enabled `XilinxStreamSwitch` architecture  
   .light[\* experimental :-)]
2. skip over the path with `packet.advance(size)`

2. .light[skip over the path with `packet.advance(size)`]
3. **Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: one for skipping 1 HF, one for skipping 2, etc.**
   Select the correct sub-parser at runtime, but the jump size is fixed at compile time.

# Implementing the parser

Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: up to .hl[max length].

Problem: To support reasonably long paths (~64 HFs), we need a lot of sub-parsers.  
⇒ Requires a lot of FPGA area + RAM to build it.

# Portability

* P4 should be target-independent, but…
  * different externs
  * different compiler limitations (ahem)
* pieces of the solution:
  * preprocessor `#define`s decouple platform from features; code depends only on features
  * our repo structure minimises work needed to add new platform

---

# Performance / Timing

* at 200MHz, the timing is very tight
* NetFPGA compiler has many bugs
  * workarounds cost extra resources
* complicated by P4 ⇒ HDL translation
  * no direct control over the resulting design

full design does not meet timing ⇒ tested:
  1. everything but updating IP overlay
  2. everything but AES
results identical

all measurements repeatable

traffic generator does not know about SCION ⇒ replays pre-generated packets
  1. everything but updating IP overlay:  
     parsing, HF validation, forwarding
  2. everything but AES:  
     parsing, timestamp check, routing, IP overlay update

processing faster than line rate,  
very even traffic distribution

⇒ no buffering :-)

---

# Analysis

.centerblock.width50[![throughput graph](../img/throughput-115B-nokey.jpg)]
- line rate, 0% packet loss achieved
- timing "almost there" ⇒ without workarounds for the bad compiler, the full design would work
  - throughput would not change

class: expanded1

# High-speed packet processing

* P4 suitable even for complex protocols
  * line rate by default!
  * but: targets may not support enough of P4
* P4-NetFPGA not suitable for complex things :-/
  * barely a PoC; very scarce documentation
* FPGA-based implementations:  
  not that many limitations, but timing can be a problem
* looking forward to more mature targets & toolchains :-)

---

class: expanded1

# Writing P4 that meets timing

* find critical path (how depends on toolchain)
* careful with data dependencies:  
  delays accumulate
  * avoid `inout` parameters in critical spots
  * full FPGA is bad
  * CAM tables are somewhat expensive ⇒ may help to combine multiple lookups into one table
  * rewrite code like this:

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div style="position: relative; margin: -1em auto; width: 90%;">
.floatleft[
```sh
if [long computation 1]
then [long computation 2]
```
]
.floatright[
```sh
[long computation 1];
[long computation 2];
[combine the results]    
```
]
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 1.4em; left: 52.5%;">⇒</div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: -1em;"></div>

# Suggestions for SCION protocol

* <strike>avoid state on routers, require few table lookups</strike> ✓
* define maximum sizes: path length, HF size
* avoid variable lengths
    * alignment is good ✓
    * HF "continue" flag should be removed
* make things explicit
    * include host address length in header
* consider re-thinking MAC chaining
    * further research into the tradeoffs is needed

# Conclusion

- P4-NetFPGA not suitable for complex projects
- P4 is a useful tool, ★★★★☆ would buy again :-)

.centerblock.width60[![throughput graph](../img/throughput-115B-nokey.jpg)]

- SCION can be forwarded at high speeds
- SCION header redesign will incorporate our (relatively minor) suggestions

You could have a special-purpose end host with a P4-enabled SmartNIC, and do some of the data processing straight in the NIC => use my parser and deparser in a completely different architecture
