- already deployed in practice
  - SCIONLab, Anapaya
- all software-based
  - limited throughput, high $$$ per bit

---

- in order to succeed, SCION must work well in HW
  - throughput, cost, energy efficiency
- actual implementation may show opportunities for design improvement

# P4

FPGA design is very time-consuming, requires expertise, and changes cost a lot of effort

⇒ P4: language for programming packet forwarding planes
* **high-level** ⇒ less effort to write and maintain
* **target-independent** ⇒ same code runs on many platforms
* **looks like software** ⇒ less need for domain expertise

???
target independent --  in theory :D

# How do FPGAs work?

# How do FPGAs work?

recurring problem in FPGA design:

.floatleft.width40[![pipeline timing broken](../img/pipeline-timingfucked.svg)]

signal propagation speed  
is finite

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

- if the circuit is too complicated, the signal propagation delay will be too large ⇒ _timing constraint violation_ ⇒ the circuit won't work
- delays accumulate

# Forwarding in SCION

* PCFS: path in packet header
* every border router processes only its own *hop field*
* checks to ensure path authorisation
  * AES-based HF MAC

# Design of the router

???

* modular
  * better while developing:
    may take a bit more time,
    but we can reuse our work
    and it simplifies debugging
  * swapping parts makes sense (e.g. AES or encaps)
  * because you can make other things with it
* integrated with existing SCION infra
  * control plane
  * monitoring / metrics

----------------------

going to talk about 3 interesting aspects:
- control plane
- path authorisation check
- parsing of SCION packet
TODO may be worth reordering?

# Challenges

among others:
* project building workflow:  
  complicated, time-consuming, not automated, buggy
* documentation: almost nonexistent and sometimes wrong
* P4-NetFPGA scripts full of bugs
* P4-NetFPGA compiler full of bugs
  * expensive workarounds needed
      * which unearth more bugs…

???
also:
* it's a lot of work!

---

## Control plane: "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"

pretend to be a NIC:  
expose network interfaces to the host,  
pass packets through when they can't be handled

.centerblock.width70[![control plane with DMA-based interfaces](../img/scion-controlplane.svg)]

⇒ use .hl[unmodified] SW router for unhandled packets

???
⇒ error handling Solved(TM)
⇒ iteratively move functionality into HW

---

# Hop field validation

1. check ingress interface
2. check timestamp and expiration
3. check MAC
  - chained ⇒ checks whole path
  - AES-CMAC with AS-specific key:  
    subkeys + **1 AES per block**

.centerblock.width90[![HF MACs chaining](../img/macs.svg)]

???
timestamp

---

# Adding AES

- AES-CMAC needed for HF MAC check
- P4 allows calling external modules through `extern` functions:  
  ```c
  extern void aes128(in  bit<128> key,
  					     in  bit<128> data,
  					     out bit<128> result);
  ```
- to add an extern, copy existing and poke at it :-/

--

.doc.bug[the module must be pipelined (was undocumented)]

--

.bug[externs corrupt state ⇒ the first table after calling an extern won't work]

???
[BEFORE CLICK]: so we did that, we copied a checksum extern and stuffed an AES module into it instead, tried it, and it worked!
But only for the first packet.
Then we needed to reboot the host and then it would again correctly calculate AES for one packet, and then it would get stuck and need a reboot again.
This does not scale very well.

# Implementing the parser

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

parser ExModDeparser(packet_mod p, in headers_t h) {
    state start {
*       p.update(h.ethernet);
        transition select(h.ethernet.ethertype) {
            ETHERTYPE_IPV4: deparse_ipv4;
            ETHERTYPE_IPV6: deparse_ipv6;
        }
    }
    …
}
```

Xilinx extension, **not** standard P4 — but standard P4 can use `varbit`

# Portability

* P4 should be target-independent, but…
  * different externs
  * different compiler limitations (ahem)
* pieces of the solution:
  * preprocessor `#define`s decouple platform from features; code depends only on features
    * `#ifdef TARGET_SUPPORTS_PACKET_MOD` rather than `#ifdef NETFPGA`
  * our repo structure minimises work needed to add new platform

---
layout: false
class: expanded1

# Area and timing constraints

* workarounds for all the bugs very expensive:  
  NetFPGA almost full (!)
* at 200 MHz, timing violated
  * originally > 6 ns, .hl[optimised down to 5.1 ns (20%)], but we need 5.0 ns
  * further attempts just move problem around
  * complicated by P4 ⇒ HDL translation:  
    not much control over the resulting design
  * 160 MHz would suffice, but changing clock is non-trivial

Spirent TestCenter traffic generator

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

full design does not meet timing ⇒ tested:
  1. everything but updating IP overlay
  2. everything but AES

(results identical)

all measurements repeatable

traffic generator does not know about SCION ⇒ replays pre-generated packets
  1. everything but updating IP overlay:  
     parsing, HF validation, forwarding
  2. everything but AES:  
     parsing, timestamp check, routing, IP overlay update

# Analysis

- line rate, 0% packet loss achieved
- timing "almost there" ⇒ without workarounds for the bad compiler, the full design would work

# High-speed packet processing

* P4 suitable even for complex protocols
  * line rate by default!
  * but: targets have notable limitations
  * not as target-independent as we had hoped
* P4-NetFPGA not suitable for complex things :-/
  * barely a PoC; very scarce documentation
* FPGA-based implementations:  
  not that many limitations, but timing can be a problem
* looking forward to more mature targets & toolchains :-)

plus new compiler

# Writing P4 that meets timing

* find critical path (how depends on toolchain)
* careful with data dependencies:  
  delays accumulate
  * avoid `inout` parameters in critical spots
  * full FPGA is bad
  * CAM tables are somewhat expensive ⇒ may help to combine multiple lookups into one table
  * rewrite code like this:

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div style="position: relative; margin: -1em auto; width: 90%;">
.floatleft[
```sh
if [long computation 1]
then [long computation 2]
```
]
.floatright[
```sh
[long computation 1];
[long computation 2];
[combine the results]    
```

# Suggestions for SCION protocol

* <strike>avoid state on routers, require few table lookups</strike> ✓
* define maximum sizes: path length, HF size
* avoid variable lengths
    * alignment is good ✓
    * HF "continue" flag should be removed
* make things explicit
    * include host address length in header
* consider re-thinking MAC chaining
    * further research into the tradeoffs is needed
