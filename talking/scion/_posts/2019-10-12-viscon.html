# SCION

future Internet architecture  

--

→ changing the Internet is really hard, so… Why?

Cloudflare, Google, Amazon, Reddit...

only one of many examples

another one: in June a lot of European traffic went through China

# What is wrong with the Internet?

originally a research network

* access was not widespread, everyone trusted everyone
* if it broke for a day, nobody cared
* end hosts were slow and stupid

--

Today​:

* many entities, they don’t trust each other
* if it breaks for a few hours, everybody cares
* end hosts are fast and smart, performance matters

???

* everyone has access and everyone has data on it

---

# What is wrong with the Internet?

In the future:

* automation ⇒ internet will really become critical infrastructure
  * drones, self-driving cars, remote robots...
* more and more data online ⇒ trust will be even more of an issue
  * geofencing (requiring data to stay within the country)
  * attacks will get harder to stop
* more data transfers and faster hosts => network will be the bottleneck

# How does the Internet work today?

you write destination IP address on packet and send it off

.floatleft.width30[![old PC](../img/old_pc.jpg)]

* no control over **how** it gets there
* no possibility of using multiple paths

???

there was bgp stuff here, and the pakistan thing, but maybe I won't even mention it?

**SCION** is designed for  
**.hl[route control]**,  
**.hl[failure isolation]**, and  
**.hl[explicit trust information]**  
for end-to-end communication

# Isolation Domains (ISDs)

.floatright.width60[![ISDs](../img/isds.png)]

* e.g. ISD ≈ country
* trust is per ISD
  * routing, certificates, DNS, etc.
* routing within ISD independent
  * malicious actors outside of your ISD cannot do anything

# Path discovery

* core ASes create *path construction beacons* (PCBs) & flood
* hierarchical:
 * inter-ISD:  
   among core ASes
 * intra-ISD:  
   only downstream
* AS receiving beacon adds itself & forwards it
  * ⇒ PCB contains known good path to core
  * adds its signature ⇒ PCBs can be verified

---

exclude: true

# Path discovery

* AS chooses how to extend / what to forward ⇒ enables routing policies
* available *path segments* registered to *path servers*
* end hosts request from path servers
* segments combined into end-to-end paths:

---

# Path awareness

* you choose the path, write it on the packet
* routers just follow the instructions ⇒ more efficient
  * efficient cryptographic checks to ensure that you are allowed to use this path
* multipath Just Works™

# Path discovery

every PCB contains *hop fields* for path construction:

* ingress, egress interface
* timestamp + expiration time
* chained cryptographic MACs with AS-specific keys ⇒ paths cannot be "invented"

# Packet forwarding

.floatright.width60[![forwarding path packet](../img/path.png)]

* path in packet header,  
  no routing tables
* every border router processes only its own *hop field*
* checks to ensure path authenticity

# Secure by design

1. provable security:  
   protocol + code
1. heterogeneous trust model:  
   ISDs
1. path-aware networking:  
   client chooses path
1. new routing + forwarding architecture:  
   beaconing; packet-carried forwarding state
1. built-in DDoS defence mechanisms:  
   hidden paths; source authentication; bandwidth reservation

# Incremental deployment

* SCION-IP gateway (SIG) enables legacy hosts to transparently use SCION
* SCION over IP enables "mixed" networks

exclude: true
# Deployment status

* incremental deployment possible
  * backward compatibility with IP
  * possibility to reuse infrastructure
* research (SCIONLab):
  * ISPs: Swisscom, SWITCH, KDDI, GEANT, DFN
  * Deployed 50 ASes worldwide
  * Global interest, e.g., ESA
* commercial (Anapaya):
  * ISPs: Deutsche Telekom, Swisscom, SWITCH, Init7
  * Bank deployment: 4 major Swiss banks, some in production use
  * Swiss government has SCION in production use
