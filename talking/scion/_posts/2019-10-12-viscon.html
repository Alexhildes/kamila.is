# SCION

future Internet architecture  

--

→ changing the Internet is really hard, so… Why?

???

Cloudflare, Google, Amazon, Reddit...

BGP route leak from the summer  
only one of many examples

another one: about 2 months ago a lot of European traffic went through China

# What is wrong with the Internet?

originally a research network

* access was not widespread, everyone trusted everyone
* if it broke for a day, nobody cared
* end hosts were slow and stupid

--

Today​:

* many entities, they don’t trust each other
* if it breaks for a few hours, everybody cares
* end hosts are fast and smart, performance matters

???

* everyone has access and everyone has data on it

---

# What is wrong with the Internet?

In the future:

* automation ⇒ internet will really become critical infrastructure
  * drones, self-driving cars, remote robots...
* more and more data online ⇒ trust will be even more of an issue
  * geofencing (requiring data to stay within the country)
  * attacks will get harder to stop
* more data transfers and faster hosts => network will be the bottleneck

---

# How does the Internet work today?

.floatright.width30[![router](../img/router.jpeg)]

* you write destination IP address on packet and send it off
  * no control over **how** it gets there
  * no possibility of using multiple paths
* **BGP** (border gateway protocol) used to tell the *routers* how to reach the destination
  * tables with prefix → next hop
  * BGP announces: "this prefix goes to me"  
    *… and everybody believes it*

---

# The YouTube/Pakistan incident

* an ISP in Pakistan wanted to block YouTube **inside Pakistan**
  * BGP announcement: "YouTube is here"
* configuration error caused the announcement to go to the rest of the world  
  _… and everybody believed it!_

# SCION

_.hl[Scalability]_  
 * packet-carried forwarding state
 * hierarchical design

_.hl[Control]_  
 * end-host selects path
 * ISPs decide available paths

_.hl[Isolation]_  
 * Isolation Domains (failures stay within one)
 * built-in DoS protection

.hl[_on Next-generation Networks]_  
 * new control plane & data plane (replaces IP + BGP)  
    * endhost-controlled multipath for free :-)  
 * provable security: protocol & code

---

class: expanded

# Isolation Domains (ISDs)

.floatright.width65[![ISDs](../img/isds.png)]

* e.g. ISD ≈ country
* PKI per ISD
* routing within ISD independent

* managed by **core ASes**: PKI, inter-ISD control plane
* non-core ASes: only intra-ISD (simple)

---

class: expanded1

.floatright.width50[![PCBs](../img/pcbs.png)]

# Path discovery

* core ASes create *path construction beacons* (PCBs) & flood
* hierarchical:
 * inter-ISD:  
   among core ASes
 * intra-ISD:  
   only downstream
* AS receiving beacon adds itself & forwards it
  * ⇒ PCB contains known good path to core
  * adds its signature ⇒ PCBs can be verified

---

# Path discovery

* AS chooses how to extend / what to forward ⇒ enables routing policies
* available *path segments* registered to *path servers*
* end hosts request from path servers
* segments combined into end-to-end paths:

.displayinlineblock.width30[![segments example 1](../img/segments1.png)]
.displayinlineblock.width30[![segments example 2](../img/segments2.png)]
.displayinlineblock.width30[![segments example 2](../img/segments3.png)]
]

---

# Path discovery

every PCB contains *hop fields* for path construction:

* ingress, egress interface
* timestamp + expiration time
* chained cryptographic MACs with AS-specific keys ⇒ paths cannot be "invented"  

.width90[![HF MACs chaining](../img/macs.svg)]

class: expanded

# Packet forwarding

.floatright.width60[![forwarding path packet](../img/path.png)]

* path in packet header,  
  no routing tables
* every border router processes only its own *hop field*
* checks to ensure path authenticity

# Secure by design

1. provable security:  
   protocol + code
1. heterogeneous trust model:  
   ISDs
1. path-aware networking:  
   client chooses path
1. new routing + forwarding architecture:  
   beaconing; packet-carried forwarding state
1. built-in DDoS defence mechanisms:  
   hidden paths; source authentication; bandwidth reservation

---

# Incremental deployment

* SCION-IP gateway (SIG) enables legacy hosts to transparently use SCION
* SCION over IP enables "mixed" networks

.centerblock.width95[![SIG deployment](../img/sig.png)]

---

# Deployment status

Research (SCIONLab):
 * ISPs: Swisscom, SWITCH, KDDI, GEANT, DFN
 * Korea: KISTI (KREONET), KU, KAIST, ETRI
 * Deployed 50 ASes worldwide
 * Global interest, e.g., ESA

Commercial (Anapaya):
 * ISPs: Deutsche Telekom, Swisscom, SWITCH, Init7
 * Bank deployment: 4 major Swiss banks, some in production use
 * Swiss government has SCION in production use

# SCION commercial development

* Anapaya Systems founded in 2017 as ETH Zurich spinoff
* current customers: banks, Swiss government, ISPs
* tight collaboration with ETH

# Conclusion: SCION is a disruptive technology that we can use today

* many network attacks impossible by design
  * communication guarantees in spite of DDoS attacks
  * route hijacks by outside actors impossible
* new security properties: geofencing, path verification, source authentication
* improved efficiency
  * multipath ⇒ increased bandwidth
  * fast failover
  * potentially cheaper & more energy-efficient HW
* international research: CH, DE, NL, US, KR, SG…
