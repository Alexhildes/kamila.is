# #1: Prod-ready SCION BR

* forwarding at **40Gbps or more**
* integrated with existing SCION infra
  * control plane
  * monitoring
* more than just “it works”:
  * metrics
  * runtime configurability
  * proper error handling

---

# #2: SCION as a library

.center[Modular, portable, high-performance P4 code for parsing, verification, and forwarding]

???

Now, why is this a good idea?
1. because modular code is easier to deal with
2. [NEXT] because you can base other things on it

---


.center.width100[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-breakdown.svg)]

???

you can take my BR and pick and choose which parts you want:

---

.center.width100[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-breakdown-swap-aes.svg)]

???

bring your own AES or even use a completely different MAC validation scheme

---

.center.width100[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-breakdown-parser.svg)]

???

change parser: swap your L2, use different encaps, or even parse the IFIDs in HFs in some special way

---

.center[Example: Special-purpose end host with a P4-capable SmartNIC]

???

You could have a special-purpose end host with a P4-enabled SmartNIC, and do some of the data processing straight in the NIC => use my parser and deparser in a completely different architecture

---

# #3: Guidelines for high-speed P4

**a) P4+NetFPGA project template suitable for large projects**

* software-engineer-friendly
* simple way to add tests
* ready for multi-platform
* already used by 2 other ETH students

---

# #3: Guidelines for high-speed P4

**b) What have we learned about high-speed P4-based packet processing on FPGAs?**

Or, tips that help software engineers write code that performs well on hardware.

* Not yet clear (still learning!)
* simple example:  
  `inout` parameters get compiled into long paths, which makes it difficult to meet timing requirements ⇒ avoid them in critical spots

???

and where to look to find out which spots are critical

???

so, those are the aims, now, how do we meet them? what are the most challenging aspects of the project?

# Challenges

???

the first challenge I encountered right at the beginning of the project was [NEXT] implementing the parser

---

layout: true

# Implementing the parser

SCION header:

.floatleft.margin0[
![header stack](./img/header-stack.svg)
]

---
???
my experience with NetFPGA, this would be different with a different compiler
---

.floatright.margin0[
First idea: Use header stacks:

```c
struct ScionHeader_t {
    ...
    HopField_h[32] seg1_hfs;
    ...
}
```
]

---

.floatright.margin0[
First idea: Use header stacks:

```c
struct ScionHeader_t {
    ...
    HopField_h[32] seg1_hfs;
    ...
}
```

.red[NetFPGA compiler does not  
support header stacks]
]

---

layout: false

# Implementing the parser

Fix: We don't need to parse the whole path, we just need to save it so we can emit it later ⇒ use a `varbit` field

.floatleft.margin0.width80[
![header stack](./img/header-stack-varbit.svg)
]

--

.floatright.margin0.red[
NetFPGA compiler does not  
support `varbit`
]

---

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

.floatleft.margin0[
```c
parser ExModDeparser(packet_mod p, in headers_t h) {
    state start {
*       p.update(h.ethernet);
        transition select(h.ethernet.ethertype) {
            ETHERTYPE_IPV4: deparse_ipv4;
            ETHERTYPE_IPV6: deparse_ipv6;
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
]

Xilinx extension, **not** standard P4 — but standard P4 can use `varbit`

---

# Implementing the parser

Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:

1. modify NetFPGA design to use the `packet_mod`-enabled `XilinxStreamSwitch` architecture  
   .light[\* experimental :-)]
2. skip over the path with `packet.advance(size)`

--

.red[NetFPGA requires even `packet.advance(size)` to be a compile-time constant]

--

.center[Therefore...]

---

# Implementing the parser

.light[Fix: Don't even save the path: use `packet_mod`:]

1. .light[modify NetFPGA design to use the `packet_mod`-enabled `XilinxStreamSwitch` architecture]  
   .light[\* experimental :-)]
2. .light[skip over the path with `packet.advance(size)`]
3. **Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: one for skipping 1 HF, one for skipping 2, etc.**
   Select the correct sub-parser at runtime, but the jump size is fixed at compile time.

---

# Implementing the parser

Create a lot of separate sub-parsers: up to max length.

Problem: To support reasonably long paths (~64 HFs), we need a lot of sub-parsers.  
⇒ Requires a lot of FPGA area + RAM to build it.

Fix: Two stages of max length 8:

---
count: false
.width100[![sqrt2](./img/sqrt2.svg)]

# Portability

actually, two problems:

* keeping the code portable despite the differences in P4 support
* making it simple to compile this BR for a different platform

---

# Portability

Pieces of the solution:
* preprocessor `#define`s decouple platform from features; code depends only on features
* well-thought-out repo structure => minimise work needed to add new platform
* do it & document it

Planning to support at least:
* NetFPGA
* P4lang's software switch

---

# Parser Performance / Timing

* at 200MHz, the timing is very tight, mostly due to the parser
* need to figure out how to improve this
* complicated by P4 => HDL translation
  * no direct control over the resulting design
* interestingly, a "hand-made" Verilog implementation has the same problem
  * by another student here at ETH

---

# Making progress quickly: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle

* modular design makes it easier to test incremental changes and locate bugs
* tackling the hard bits first ⇒ I can't get stuck
* the NetFPGA's P4 stack is pretty much a PoC; documentation is generally severely lacking  
  therefore:
  * try things ASAP
  * change plan if something doesn't work
  * **guess**

---

# Making progress quickly: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle

.center.width80.pushup[![Parts of the project](./img/scion-controlplane.svg)]

transparently pass unhandled packets to SW through 1:1 "fake" network interfaces (really DMA)  
⇒ iteratively move functionality into HW

The look of this slide: cases pic from SCION book that shows which cases I implement and then on click a big number saying 40Gbps (hopefully :D)
