<div class="content">

<p>The careful text-books measure<br />
    (Let all who build beware!)<br />
The load, the shock, the pressure<br />
    Material can bear.<br />
So, when the buckled girder<br />
    Lets down the grinding span,<br />
The blame of loss, or murder,<br />
    Is laid upon the man.<br />
        <em>Not on the Stuff—the Man!</em></p>
<p>But in our daily dealing<br />
    With stone and steel, we find<br />
The Gods have no such feeling<br />
    Of justice toward mankind.<br />
To no set gauge they make us—<br />
    For no laid course prepare—<br />
And presently o'ertake us<br />
    With loads we cannot bear:<br />
        <em>Too merciless to bear.</em></p>
<p>The prudent text-books give it<br />
    In tables at the end—<br />
The stress that shears a rivet<br />
    Or makes a tie-bar bend—<br />
What traffic wrecks macadam—<br />
    What concrete should endure—<br />
But we, poor Sons of Adam,<br />
    Have no such literature,<br />
        <em>To warn us or make sure!</em></p>
<p>We hold all Earth to plunder—<br />
    All Time and Space as well—<br />
Too wonder-stale to wonder<br />
    At each new miracle;<br />
Till, in the mid-illusion<br />
    Of Godhead 'neath our hand,<br />
Falls multiple confusion<br />
    On all we did or planned—<br />
        <em>The mighty works we planned.</em></p>
<p>We only of Creation<br />
    <em>(Oh, luckier bridge and rail!)</em><br />
Abide the twin-damnation—<br />
    To fail and know we fail.<br />
Yet we - by which sole token<br />
    We know we once were Gods—<br />
Take shame in being broken<br />
    However great the odds—<br />
        <em>The Burden or the Odds.</em></p>
<p>Oh, veiled and secret Power<br />
    Whose paths we seek in vain,<br />
Be with us in our hour<br />
    Of overthrow and pain;<br />
That we - by which sure token<br />
    We know Thy ways are true—<br />
In spite of being broken,<br />
    <em>Because of being broken,</em><br />
        <em>May rise and build anew.</em><br />
        <em>Stand up and build anew.</em></p>
