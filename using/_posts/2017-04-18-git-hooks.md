title: Git hooks

[Git hooks](http://githooks.com/) enable you to do things when something happens in a Git repo. My favorite use is "push to deploy": when I push new commits to a server, it will compile the thing and deploy a new version into production.

Therefore:

- finding out what is deployed in production is trivial
- deploying a new release is trivial
  - and therefore there is little incentive to do horrible things like ssh-ing into prod and hotfixing things there :-)

I use it everywhere, because I have made it trivial to set up by writing it down :-)

For setup + code, see [github.com/anotherkamila/git-hooks](https://github.com/anotherkamila/git-hooks), naturally.
