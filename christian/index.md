On the good days I see how beautiful and well-thought-out the world appears to be, and I want to thank someone for it;  
on the bad days, I refuse to lose the hope that suffering has a point;  
and on the clear days I see how I keep failing at living according to my conscience, I want to ask somebody for forgiveness, I know I don't deserve to be forgiven, and as far as I know a certain guy 2000 years ago was the only one ever who really dealt with mercy instead of trying to deserve things.  

It seems to me that given these constraints, Christianity is the only framework that makes sense to me. And, much to my surprise, it often tends to make much more sense than I first expect. Confirmation bias and all that, I know, but nothing else I've heard seems to fit quite as well. I think the key thing is mercy, because humans always fail, and Christ is the only person ever from whom I've heard a satisfactory answer to that.

Yes, I do find Christianity hard to believe. I do struggle with that. But I find everything else even harder to believe. And Christianity is strange enough to look right in this strange world :-)

[Some people smarter than me have written good books about this.](/reading/christianity)
