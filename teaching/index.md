Things I wrote that hopefully might be useful to other people (such as you, dear reader).

* [Shell Tutorial for Absolute Beginners](shell) --  Teaches the basics of using the command line on FreeBSD or Linux. Uses the Fish shell.
* [How do Routers Work, Really?](how-routers-work) -- An understandable, quick, yet accurate overview of how how exactly a router operates. Complete with the source code of one.
