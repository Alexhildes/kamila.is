title: Good Books about Christianity
---

These two books are awesome (and do a good job capturing what is also my reasoning (and are partially responsible for my reasoning)):

- **C. S. Lewis: Mere Christianity** -- An introduction to what Christianity is really about (as opposed to what some people think).
- **G. K. Chesterton: Orthodoxy** -- A former atheist's thinking, or how it ends up when you go under the surface and look for truth. A real joy to read (at least for me).

---------------------------------------------------------

I should also mention these two (yes, I do like C. S. Lewis). They already require some understanding of Christianity, and do a good job deepening it. They should be read in this order, one after another, for maximum experience.

1. **C. S. Lewis: The Problem of Pain** -- A very reasonable look at pain and suffering.
2. **C. S. Lewis: A Grief Observed** -- Notes written shortly after his wife's death. A different look at the same problem. Difficult reading, very much worth it.
