TLDR? [Skip to the summary](#summary).

I used to have a kamila.is/christian page. Nowadays I am a bit reluctant to use that label, because I do not accept some non-core parts of Christianity / because the label carries a lot of stuff I am not.

However, I maintain the following:

1. Something fishy happened 200 years ago in the Middle East. According to the Gospels, this Jesus person said and did a lot of things which were
   1. surprisingly reasonable,
   2. surprisingly inappropriate at that time and place.
   Especially due to (1.2), I find it somewhat unlikely that Christianity would have grown so large AND would not have been edited to remove the inappropriate bits if it didn't have some real basis.
2. The probability I assign to Jesus being God is less than 100%, but due to (1) it is more than "vanishingly small". Weighed by the insane importance of what it would mean if it were true, I think the possibility should not be ignored. Luckily I agree with the core of what Jesus said!
3. Most importantly: I observe an inner moral compass that I consistently fail to follow. I also observe failure to follow the moral compass (whether mine or theirs) with other people. Humans just are not very good at being good. While other ideologies are concerned with deserving things and doing things ourselves, which clearly doesn't work, Christ talked about mercy. I strongly believe that [mercy, understanding, and tolerance towards everyone (not just "us") is key](TODO), and this is the core of what Jesus said. I can stand behind that.

So, in summary: I am uncertain about everything but one thing: [we really need to be nice to other people](TODO) (yes, even those we don't agree with).
