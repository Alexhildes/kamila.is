Kamila is coding. Um. A lot.

As of now I have about 80 GitHub repos, because I am messy. These are the large projects I consider active (though maybe they don't look like that right now...):

- [Songbook](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/songbook-web): A neat, mobile-friendly, and human-friendly songbook + sheet music organizer (web app with offline capabilities [not yet]).
    - **Status**: Usable, though far from finished. Can display chords or sheet music, and can transpose!
    - **Dev status**:
        - Expect heavy changes once the winter semester is over.
        - API frozen, as I am secretly moving to Django.
        - web UI frozen until API unfreeze because I want login. And it may or may not get rewritten into Elm.
        - Contributions are very much welcome, but maybe not right now because right now it's terrible ;-)
- [Tasksched](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/tasksched): An opinionated Taskwarrior web UI: perfect for scheduling tasks. Somewhat inspired by Todoist, but only somewhat ;-)
    - **Status**: Usable for scheduling (and rescheduling and unscheduling), though I haven't written installation instructions yet. Scheduling is the only thing it can do now, but you have the CLI for the rest ;-)
    - **Dev status**:
        - Written in Elm, so changes are cheap. Small improvements might come in quite frequently.
        - Contributions are welcome! Though far from "perfectly clean", this app is IMHO not terrible!
- [OutSurfing](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/outsurfing): "Couchsurfing for outdoor activities" -- a platform for finding companions for hikes, skiing or anything, based on preferences and time constraints. In fact, it will be able to do anything, not just outdoor. Therefore it needs a better name.
    - **Status**: Planning stage, nothing is implemented. But I intend to start soonish!
    - **Dev status**: Nothing is implemented, but I intend to do a Django backend + Elm web app.

Smaller projects that should not be deleted (unlike some of my other smaller projects):

- various small contributions to [cdist](https://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/) -- the least terrible configuration management
- [tarsnap-periodic](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/tarsnap-periodic)
- [monitoring-tools](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/monitoring-tools)
- [yamlCV](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/yamlCV)
- [currency-exchange-rates](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/currency-exchange-rates)
- [lego-wet-roomba](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/lego-wet-roomba)
- Can I brag about [chaOS](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/chaOS) here? It's not active. But it was fun! And the logo is the best thing I've ever drawn ;-)
- [composing_fractals](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/composing_fractals): useless, but pretty!

Check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/anotherkamila/) for a nearly-infinite list of repos, some of which are dead and good for them, and some of which live on until they die by accident.
