Due to COVID-19, my graduation ceremony for the Master's at ETH was postponed and eventually held virtually. Instead of meatspace participation, we (the ex-students) were asked to record a short video of ourselves. The instructions were quite precise: Use the provided virtual background, walk in from the left, stop in front of the camera and pose, then walk away to the right. So I did exactly as they told me:

<video controls >
<source src="/media/hot.mp4" type="video/mp4">
IR video of me
</video>

The instructions did not specify that the recording needed to be done in the visible spectrum :-)

Also, while we're at it, have a kitten or two:
